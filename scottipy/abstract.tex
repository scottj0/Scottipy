Spotify collects hundreds of data points for every song in their massive catalog
of music. Information on features of the song, as well as meta-data about the
artist, can paint a near complete picture that can be analyzed and compared to
other songs. Despite this breadth of data, music discovery on Spotify is lacking
in many ways. Other than a single automatic and static weekly playlist, there is
no easy way to find new music related to a user's taste and preferences. This
thesis paper explores the creation of a web-based playlist creator and editor, dubbed
"Scottipy", using Spotipy, a Python wrapper for the official Spotify API. This project
seeks to extend the current boundaries of music personalization.
