\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

If I had to complete this on my own, I wouldn't have been able to. I first have
to thank my parents, as well of the rest of my family, for supporting me even when
I doubted myself. Thanks to Dr. Mohan and Dr. Kapfhammer, and all of my professors
and peers in the Allegheny Computer Science Department. Shouts out to my friends
and roommates, you kept me going. Special thanks to Jon Schaeffer and Zac Shaffer,
for the 11th hour bug squashing.
